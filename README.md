# The Test Task for Xneelo

The easiest way to quickly deploy a project is to use the migration plugin. 
In our case, I have prepared for you [an archive and installation file](https://github.com/ihormazurenko/test-xneelo/tree/master/deployment) of the Duplicator plugin.

1. After the files have been downloaded successfully, move the two files (installer.php and zip-archive) into the empty folder you'll want the WordPress site in.
2. In a web browser (with your server running) visit the installer.php file (for example, newdomain.com/installer.php).
3. If everything works, you should see a wizard screen. You'll need to click "I have read and accept all terms & notices."
4. Click "Next."
5. Here you'll need to have a database ready. Then tell Duplicator your database name, user, and password.
6. If it all works, you'll see "Step 4 of 4: Test Site". There you'll want to click the "Site Login" button, and log in to your WordPress using the same username and password as I created for local installation (login: xneelo-admin | pass: ll&dRmd%71DeubmgEy).
7. Here you go! You should now be in a full-fledged copy of that test installation.

Please let me know if you have any issues with that.
